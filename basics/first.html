    <h1>Galaxy✨</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to the galaxy of knowledge!.</h2>

  <p>
  Our universe is home to breathtaking wonders, from vibrant planets to mysterious black holes. 🪐  
  Planets like Earth, Mars, and Jupiter orbit stars and come in a variety of sizes and compositions — rocky, gaseous, and icy.  
  Each one tells a different story of formation and evolution.✨<br>
  On the other end of the cosmic spectrum lie black holes — regions of space where gravity is so strong, not even light can escape.  
  Formed from the remnants of massive stars, black holes challenge our understanding of physics and time.  
  Together, planets and black holes represent the beautiful contrast of creation and collapse in the ever-expanding universe🌌.
